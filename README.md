Weather Archive Dashboard
=========================


Introduction
-----------

This React application is a weather dashboard. It displays real-time weather data fetched from a custom Rails API I built. Users can define the location and time period, and the dashboard will visualize the data using three key features: informative statistics, interactive charts, and detailed tables. These features showcase various weather metrics like temperature, humidity, rain, snow, sunshine duration, solar irradiance, weather code, and wind speed. It even calculates the possible solar energy that could be harnessed on that given period and the average weather event ilustrated with an SVG with a custom animation.

This application has also been deployed using Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://weather-archive-xp.netlify.app/).
